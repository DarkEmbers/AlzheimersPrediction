# Week 8
## Summary
 - started implementing Decision Trees on the numeric data set
 - found an ideal number of clusters using elbow method
 - did cluster analysis with silhouette score
 - Worked on Linear Classifier
 - Started working Naive Bayes
 - Did a thorough exploration of MLP and used various different configurations for the tabular dataset

## Challenges
- CDR is too good of an indicator
- Without CDR the model performs poorly and overfits
- Getting reproducable results for MLP was a challenge

## Next Steps:
- find ways to optimize DT wihtout CDR and use hyperparameters.
- systematically finding the optimal CNN architecture
